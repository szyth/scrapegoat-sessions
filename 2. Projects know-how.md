**Projects: Most important thing in your profile**.
_While approaching Off campus jobs, your Public Profile(Resume, LinkedIn, Github) is the first impression to the Hiring Team._
_And the Profile's most important section is your Projects._

## Choosing a language
- a language that covers Computer Programming Concepts with the least programming abstractions, basically Low level or Mid Level languages.
- a language which teaches, pointers, memory management, garbage collection, threading etc
- a language that is closer to the kernel.
- eg: Rust, C, C++, Java, etc


_Note that it is always beneficial to learn a Low level language as you can easily switch to a Higher level language if needed for some reason, but going from High to Low level langauge takes a LOT OF EFFORT._
